### User database

As a customer i want to get all the info about particular user.

Use proper data structure.
Search should be case non-sensitive ( Mike and mike should have same result).
You don’t need to provide particular user’s name via cli parameter or flag, just do in code (statically).

Go Tour
Stringer Interface

Check map data structure
Check fmt package
